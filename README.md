# Optimising Models using Python PuLP and Excel Solver

This repository contains various optimization models implemented using the PuLP library in Python. PuLP is a powerful library for linear programming and mixed-integer programming that leverages external solvers like CBC, GLPK, and CPLEX.

This repository showcases a variety of linear programming problems solved using the PuLP library. Each example demonstrates how to define decision variables, objective functions, and constraints to solve real-world optimization problems.


# Python PuLP Models

## Multiperiod Production Smoothing Model
This model helps in planning production over multiple periods to minimize costs associated with inventory holding and production rate changes. The example script demonstrates how to set up and solve this problem using PuLP.

This code can be used separately by downloading the file from repository and running
```bash
python Multiperiod Production Smoothing Model.py 
```

## Bus Scheduling Model
This model determines the optimal schedule for buses to meet demand during different time periods of the day while minimizing the total number of buses used

This code can be used separately by downloading the file from repository and running
```bash
python Bus Scheduling Model.py 
```

## SunRay Transport Model
This model optimizes the transportation costs of shipping goods from multiple sources to multiple destinations, ensuring supply meets demand.

This code can be used separately by downloading the file from repository and running
```bash
python SunRay Transport Model.py
```

## Installing Security Telephones Model
This model is used to determine the minimum number of security telephones required to cover all streets in a network of intersections.

This code can be used separately by downloading the file from repository and running
```bash
python Installing Telephones Optimal.py
```

## Telephone Company Model
This model helps a telephone company minimize costs while ensuring a specific number of total call minutes is distributed across three service providers.

This code can be used separately by downloading the file from repository and running
```bash
python Telephone Company Model.py
```

# Excel Solver Models
These models involve solving optimization problems using data provided in Excel files. The examples include:
```bash
6.3-6.xlsx
9.1-2.xlsx
9.1-3.xlsx
```
